# 🧠 Time-LLM — Unified Transformer + LLM Framework for Time-Series Forecasting

> **Author:** Raj Patil (IIT Patna | B.Tech AI & Data Science 2026)
> **Primary Goal:** Research-grade yet production-ready framework that fuses **Temporal Transformers** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for intelligent, explainable, and data-efficient forecasting.

## 🚀 Overview

`Time-LLM` is a **modern re-implementation and extension** of classical temporal forecasting architectures such as **Autoformer** and **DLinear**, augmented with a **language-model–aware reasoning module**.
This repository is designed for:

* 🔬 **ML/AI research** in temporal modeling
* 🧩 **MLOps deployment experiments**
* 💼 **Industry-grade forecasting pipelines** (energy, finance, retail, etc.)

Unlike existing public repos (e.g., *KimMeen/Time-LLM*), this version emphasizes:
